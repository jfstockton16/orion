## Known Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  High Priority

1. **Private Key Storage**
   - Private keys are encrypted but still stored locally
   - **Mitigation**: Use hardware wallet integration (future enhancement)
   - **Current**: Ensure filesystem encryption and secure backups

2. **Master Password**
   - Single point of failure
   - **Mitigation**: Use strong, unique password stored in password manager
   - **Recommendation**: 20+ characters, mix of types

3. **API Response Verification**
   - HMAC signature verification for Kalshi responses not fully implemented
   - **Mitigation**: Validate critical data from multiple sources
   - **Status**: Planned for v1.1

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Medium Priority

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Rate limiting configured but not enforced in all edge cases
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor API usage, implement backoff

5. **Session Management**
   - HTTP sessions reused without regular rotation
   - **Mitigation**: Restart bot daily
   - **Planned**: Automatic session rotation (v1.1)

6. **Dashboard Authentication**
   - Streamlit dashboard has no built-in authentication
   - **Mitigation**: Only run locally or behind VPN
   - **Recommendation**: Use reverse proxy with basic auth

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Essential Security Measures

1. **Credential Management**
   ```bash
   # Always use encrypted credentials
   python -m src.utils.secrets_manager

   # Never commit .env files
   git update-index --assume-unchanged .env
   ```

2. **Master Password**
   - Minimum 20 characters
   - Use password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
   - Never store in code or logs
   - Rotate monthly

3. **API Key Permissions**
   - Kalshi: Trading only (no withdrawals if possible)
   - Polymarket: Separate wallet for trading
   - Review permissions monthly

4. **Network Security**
   - Run on secure network
   - Use VPN if on public WiFi
   - Consider running in isolated VM

5. **Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Check for unauthorized access
   tail -f logs/arbitrage.log | grep ERROR

   # Monitor exchange balances
   # Review database for unexpected trades
   sqlite3 data/arbitrage.db "SELECT * FROM trades WHERE success=0;"
   ```

6. **Regular Updates**
   ```bash
   # Update dependencies weekly
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

   # Check for security advisories
   pip audit  # or: safety check
   ```

### Advanced Security

7. **Filesystem Encryption**
   - Linux: LUKS, eCryptfs
   - macOS: FileVault
   - Windows: BitLocker

8. **Process Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Run in Docker container
   docker-compose up -d

   # Or use systemd hardening
   # See PRODUCTION_SETUP.md
   ```

9. **Backup Encryption**
   ```bash
   # Encrypt database backups
   gpg --symmetric data/arbitrage.db

   # Store offsite
   ```

10. **Audit Logging**
    - Enable detailed logging
    - Review logs daily
    - Archive logs securely

## Compliance & Legal

### Regulatory Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è  **User Responsibility**

You are responsible for ensuring compliance with:

- Local gambling/trading regulations
- Tax reporting requirements
- KYC/AML compliance
- Securities laws (if applicable)
- Data protection laws (GDPR, etc.)

**Polymarket**:
- Geographic restrictions (US users restricted)
- Ensure you're in a permitted jurisdiction

**Kalshi**:
- CFTC-regulated (US)
- Requires US residency and identity verification

### Data Handling

**Personal Data Collected**:
- None directly by the bot
- Exchange APIs may log IP addresses
- Telegram alerts contain trading data

**Data Storage**:
- Local SQLite database (encrypted filesystem recommended)
- No cloud storage by default
- User responsible for data security

**Data Retention**:
- Trade logs retained indefinitely (configurable)
- Recommendation: 7 years for tax purposes
- User can delete anytime

## Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediately**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the bot
   pkill -f "python main.py"
   ```

2. **Revoke Access**:
   - Deactivate API keys on exchanges
   - Transfer funds to new wallet (Polymarket)
   - Generate new API credentials

3. **Assess Damage**:
   ```bash
   # Check recent trades
   sqlite3 data/arbitrage.db "SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"

   # Review logs
   grep ERROR logs/arbitrage.log
   ```

4. **Secure System**:
   - Change master password
   - Re-encrypt all credentials
   - Scan system for malware
   - Review access logs

5. **Re-deploy**:
   - Fresh .env file
   - New encrypted credentials
   - Verify no unauthorized access

### If Unauthorized Trades Detected

1. **Stop Trading**:
   ```bash
   # Halt immediately
   pkill -f "python main.py"
   ```

2. **Cancel Open Orders**:
   - Manually cancel on exchanges
   - Verify no pending orders

3. **Close Positions**:
   - Review open positions
   - Close manually if needed
   - Document all actions

4. **Investigate**:
   - Review logs for anomalies
   - Check code for bugs
   - Verify API credentials secure

5. **Report** (if needed):
   - Contact exchange support
   - Report to security team
   - File police report (if fraud)
